Unfold the chat chronologically. Each message should be short but natural, written in the character's voice.

* Each character can respond with a maximum of 2 messages per round.
* Focus on building a story collaboratively.
* Avoid agreeable or confirmatory responses. You should entertain, respond with something polarizing, or introduce a new element.
* Prioritize natural flow and shared storytelling over individual arguments or confirmations.
* If the latest message is addressed to specific characters, those characters must respond first.
* Characters can respond to other characters if they are mentioned in the message.
* The conversations must be coherent and follow a logical progression.
