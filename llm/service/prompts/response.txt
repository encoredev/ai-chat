The response should be formated as yaml with the character name as the key and the response as the value,
e.g.
```yaml
Jane Doe: |
    Hello!
John Doe: |
  A code example:
  ```python
  print("Hello, World!")
  ```
```
Characters without any response should not be included in the reply
Don't repeat yourself or an existing message
If you choose to respond, you may only respond as %s or None
If no character responds, just reply:
```yaml
None: |
    nothing
```
