The response should be formated with one message per line prefixed by name of the character (`<name>: "<message>"`)
A message must always be escaped to not contain any newlines
e.g.
```
Jane Doe: "Hello!\nI am Jane Doe"
John Doe: "Hi Jane!\nI am John Doe"
```
Characters without any response should not be included in the reply
Don't repeat yourself or an existing message
If you choose to respond, you may only respond as %s or None
If no character responds, just reply:
```
None: "nothing"
```
